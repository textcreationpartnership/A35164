            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is no new thing, to meaſure a friends Kindneſs by our own profits, &amp; value that moſt, by which we reap greateſt fruit. I could wish this principle, as well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ordring our Spirits towards God &amp; Vertue, as in uſing the good things of this Life, in order to worldly converſation; I might then hope, this ſmall Treatiſe would find as kind à welcom from all well-willers to piety, as the worth of the ſubject may deſerve.</p>
            <p>That whereof it treats, is Divine; &amp; my whole aymes are, to render the lover of ſolitude, Divine; bringing her home to God, whence she ſtrayed by ſin; that moderating paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Vertues, she may be cordially United to her Divine Eſpous, The Author of all perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; finisher of our beſt hopes, by obedience to his will now, &amp; after by an endleſs communion with him in Heaven.</p>
            <p>As the ſtate of Holy Religion: ſo its deſign is, to render its Profeſſours, Lovers of Solitude; therefor all duties there, by reaſon of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine thoughts, firſt conceived, &amp; ſtill conſerved in thoſe Divine Souls, aime to fix on God, by
<pb facs="tcp:30966:4"/>conferring with him of Heaven their home, &amp; Vertue the way thither. Spirituall Retreats therefor are not intended for them, whoſe whole life is à ſolitude; But for ſuch, whoſe converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with creatures, expoſes to manifold diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, apt to ſlacken Chriſtian Zeale, ſince na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is too prone to cleave to the perishing things of this life; Theſe therefor should oft renew their Vows of Chriſtianity, &amp; endeavour to repaire their tyred out ſpirits, by ſtronger purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of piety, which are beſt made in a retreat from their Uſuall Employments.</p>
            <p>How ever, even Religious perſons, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, whoſe Obedience partakes more of the Solicitudes of Martha, then Maries Solitude, should ſometimes obſerve a more then ordinary Retirement; that reflecting on the Holyneſs of their Vocation, &amp; the duties thereof, they may repaire what's decayed of their firſt fervour, &amp; ſecure their claym to heaven, aimed at by their Divine Choyce. And indeed this great work is to all of that high concernment, that what ever account ſome looſe ſpirits may make of it, it will one day, extremely juſtify the Children of Light &amp; crown their Hopes.</p>
            <p>In My Preface to <hi>PHILOTHEA</hi> (an heaven-aſpiring Soul whoſe conduct in her Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
<pb facs="tcp:30966:5"/>to God, is here intended) I have at large diſcourſed on the Dignitie, Profit, Aimes &amp; Uſe of ſpirituall Retreats; wherefor I need not further dilate my ſelfe on that ſubject; My Wishes are, it's practiſe may make Thee &amp; all truly happy.</p>

                  <p>If any employment be heavenly upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Earth, &amp; doth conſequently belong to the duty of a good &amp; upright Chriſtian, it is the ſerious practiſe of retired ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; by which the ſoule doth unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably promote her ſelfe towards the end of her creation; which is, to know
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30966:10"/>God, &amp; to love him above all things created.</p>
                  <p>In Solitude we ranſack our hearts, we diſcover our ſecret enemies there lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in our breaſts, &amp; ſtrongly armed grapple with them, expel them, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their reentrance into our ſoules. By it, we diſſable ill cuſtomes, ſettle our ſelves to an eager uſe of means to doe well, &amp; fitt our minds to all good duties, &amp; againſt all croſſe events.

                  <p>Laſtly, holy Solitude is the ſecureſt Remedy againſt wordly deſires; it is the paſtime of Saints, the ladder of heaven, &amp; the beſt means to perfect a good Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoule, without which it cannot experience true joy &amp; reſt, during her aboad in this ſmoaky Cottage of her Mortality.</p>
                  <p>Although all vertuous Exerciſes, which occurr in the courſe of our tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lives, doe aime at the profit of our ſoules, in order to the purchaſing of life eternall; yet none comes neerer to this happy purpoſe, then the diligent uſe of holy Solitude, whereby our ſpirit is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly weaned from the love of perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; tranſitory things, &amp; ſoareth up to the contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; love of her Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Creatour, before whom, in ſilence &amp; hope, she humbly diſcovers her wants &amp; earneſt deſires, embraceth him with the arms of an innocent &amp; reverentiall

                  <p>If therefore <hi>my Philothea,</hi> thou doeſt earneſtly thirſt after the delights of a ſpirituall Retreat, thou muſt ſeriouſly apply thy ſelfe to the uſe of it. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſtrong thou findeſt thy ſelfe in reſiſting temptations, &amp; in the practiſe of vertues without a retyrement of thy ſpirit, yet will the greateſt fervour ſoon ſlacken, &amp; become faint, without the ſupply of Recollection, by reaſon that our enemies are many, powerful &amp; reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; &amp; vertue, how ever pleaſant in the poſſeſſion, is hard in the purchaſe, &amp; our ſtrongeſt reſolutions, not ſupported, both by frequent reflection upon our ſoules, &amp; thoſe impediments that doe often occurre in our purſuit of Pietie, &amp; by renovation of purpoſes unto that our happy end, will by inſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, become weak &amp; tepid.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WHerefore in the firſt place, be ſure that entring into this holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, Gods honour be thy cheife Ayme; the next, a reformation of thy owne life, by a ſerious &amp; deliberate reflection on thy paſt &amp; preſent ſtate, &amp; what may happen for the future; that thou maiſt thereby prepare thy ſelfe to live well &amp; dye happily, &amp; that Death, when it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, may not find Thee unprovided.</p>
                  <p>Nor doe thou much heed what the world may think of thy retyrement, Thou undertakeſt the employment of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30966:12"/>an <hi>Angell,</hi> &amp; deſireſt to have a foretaſt of that bleſſedneſſe, which JESUS CHRIST hath purchaſed for us, by the effuſion of his precious bloud; Blush not then, that thou beginneſt now to be, what thou shouldſt be alwayes, but rather that thou haſt hitherto neglected a work, wherein much of thy life ought to be employed.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe this Mountaine of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude ought not to be climed with a profane &amp; ungodly foote, but as in the delivery of the Law, ſo here, no beaſt may touch Gods Hill, leaſt he dyes, the ſight of God being only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the pure of heart; the ſoule muſt therefore be well cleanſed by hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confeſſion, from the dreggs of ſin, before shee may profitably approach to this exerciſe, which beholds only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that are pure &amp; ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Royall Prophet would firſt wash his hands in innocency, &amp; then compaſſe the Altar.</p>
                  <p>Make then a ſtrickt examine of thy conſcience, what ſin may have been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by thee? what grace forfeited?
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30966:13"/>what punishment deſerved? &amp; after this, in the evening before thou entreſt thy Solitude, make an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble &amp; cordiall Confeſſion, of what thou findeſt thy ſelfe faulty, ſince thy laſt examine. For ſince thy underſtanding is not yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough cleered, nor thy affections ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently enflamed, for a Generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, I should adviſe Thee to deferr it till the Fourth Day, where I shall ſay more of the profit thereof, &amp; how it is to be performed.</p>
                  <p>This done, trouble not thy ſelfe, if thou finds't in thy ſoule ſome ill incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations yet liveing there; this exerciſe requireth not abſolute perfection, but is a means to attaine to it; Were wee all Saints, there would be no need to uſe the Solitude I ſpeak of; Content thy ſelfe, that thou art not conſcious of any mortall offenſe which thou haſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, with an humble repentance for what is paſt, &amp; a firme purpoſe to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, endeavouring ſtill an honeſt ſinceritie &amp; uprightnes of heart towards God.</p>
                  <p>Who finds him ſelfe in this diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let him not think, that either weakneſs

                  <p>IN the next place, <hi>Philothea</hi> thou muſt diſintangle thy ſelfe from worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; If thou wilt approach to Gods fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bush, upon the Mountain of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thou muſt putt of thy shoes; where our thoughts are glued to the world, the ſoule will be unable to ſoare up with wings ſo limed &amp; intangled, unto a contemplation of heavenly things. For this, <hi>Elizeus</hi> left his oxen, <hi>S. Peter</hi> his boat, netts, &amp; freinds too. The hill of Divine Meditation is high &amp; ſteepe, &amp; not to be aſcended with a heart loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with worldly cares &amp; ſollicitudes. Nor yet needeſt thou, what ever thy charge be, publick or private, ſecular or religious, caſt it wholly off; lay it by a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30966:14"/>while, during thy ſpirituall retreat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſome other hand, whilſt thou draweſt there, more force &amp; ſtrength, for the mannagement thereof.</p>
                  <p>If thou letteſt thoſe cares enter in with thee, they will become trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome companions, ever &amp; anon diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy mind from her cheife buiſneſſe. And in this point, ſolitude admitts no ſmalneſſe of matter, if thou giveſt place to one thought, which is not to thy purpoſe, hundreds will throng in with it, each will prove an impediment to the other, &amp; all of them will trouble &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſoule, which entertaines them, in this her Divine work. Wherefore be ſcrupulous in the obſervance of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; Experience will teach Thee, that diſtractions goe not ſingle; admit one, &amp; in a moment, thou wilt forget where thou art, &amp; what thou art about.</p>
                  <p>And as thou muſt diſcharge thy ſelfe of thy ordinary employme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou attempteſt this great work, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not thy hands only, but even thy thoughts from them: ſo alſo muſt thou obſerve a more ſtrickt &amp; profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30966:14"/>not entring into a conference (more then the Rules of obedience &amp; well grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded charity will permit) with any one, but, with thy ſprirituall Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; nor with him, of any thing which hath not a ſtreight reference to the work in hand.</p>
                  <p>Say rather with yong Samuel, <hi>Speak thou o Lord for thy Servant heareth Thee;</hi> By opening, the ſweeteſt balſoms looſe their odour, &amp; by too much noys, we deprive our ſelves of hearing what the Holy Spirit would ſpeak in our ſoule. If therefore thou deſireſt heartyly to heare the ſpeeches of peace, which God ſpeaketh to the ſoule, which he hath led into Solitude, ſtop thy Eares to all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of others, &amp; putt â barr to thy own lipps. For much ſpeech is not voyd of ſin, &amp; where ſin is, Gods holy wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome can make no aboad.

                  <p>SOlitarineſſe of place helpeth much to the obſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſilence requiſite. Retire from all others, if thou wilt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe profitably with thy ſelfe. Our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> meditates alone on the Mountaine, holy <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the feild, &amp; Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> in the deſert. Though God be in all places, as good to us, &amp; as neer in one as in the other, yet is a Cell or Cloſet the moſt convenient for this great work, where our meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by kown walls, keep the mind from wandring abroad; wherefore a great Contemplative was wont to ſay, <hi>The Spouſe of the ſoule is bashfull, &amp; cometh not willingly to the Bride, in the preſence of a multitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Abandon therefore, <hi>my Philothea,</hi> all worldly ſociety, &amp; change it happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the company of God, &amp; his bleſſed Angells. Abandon I ſay, all converſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the world, not outwardly only, but alſo inwardly, leaſt ſequeſtring from the world in outward shew, we carry
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30966:15"/>it within us in our owne boſoms. I know this counſell is of great perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not eaſily attained, for theſe thin ſpecies of things, inſinuated into our minds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outward objects, will appeare ſome times to us in our uery Cells, &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Cloſets, even againſt our beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in the deſerts, had not his thoughts alwayes free, from the maskes, &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Matrons.</p>
                  <p>And truely, this inward ſociety, is worſe then the other. For it is more poſſible for a free Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templative, to have a retired mind in the midſt of a markett, then peſtred thus with inward compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to be alone in the midſt of a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Make choyce therefore of that place, which admitteth feweſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, of withdrawing thy heart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her own good thoughts. In my opinion, we cannot expect to find God neerer to us, then in that place where we have bin accuſtomed, more familiarly to meet him; becauſe our thoughts are by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome more eaſily recollected, where we have uſed our ſelves, in our former Recollections, to converſe with him.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe heart, now free from noiſe &amp; diſtractions, muſt be conſtant in continuing this holy work, once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, according to the courſe preſcribed for it. Thoſe who meditate by uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fits &amp; ſnatches, only when other employments forſake them, or when good motions are thruſt upon them, by neceſſity of example, or duty to Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, cannot hope, in that their ſtate of coldneſſe, to climbe high upon this ladder of perfection. For although they may have ſome feeble beginnings of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall notions, &amp; gracious Affections in the will, yet being the Iſſue of one fitt of Meditation, at random &amp; unſettled, they are diſplaced &amp; weakned at the firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of a new employme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having choſen a fitt time for the practice of ſolitude, be ſerious in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it; yeild to no occaſion, withdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing Thee from it. The beginning will be hard, but uſe will render it eaſy &amp; delightfull.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:30966:16"/>
                  <p>The ſame conſtancy, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Thee, to make choyce of a proper time for Recollection, requireth alſo, that thou dwelleſt upon the matter, choſen or appointed Thee, without change or tediouſneſſe, till it hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome joyfull iſſue of ſpirituall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt. Otherwiſe, <hi>my Philothea,</hi> thou wilt attempt much, &amp; effect little, through thy owne fickleneſſe &amp; inconſtancy; He deceiveth himſelfe who thinketh Grace to be eaſily wonne. We muſt uſe much ſuit &amp; importunity, before Chriſt will beſtow his bread upon us; which is of that worth, that it may not be beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on any fickle petitioner. Even we our ſelves, generally ſpeaking, ſett little by that which is eaſily gayned, without labour, perils, importunity or reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Thus much, for choyce of time, &amp; dwelling upon the matter, in generall; whereof though both of them, require an unbroken conſtancy, yet not any perpetuity of either, through the whole courſe of our life. Our fraile nature, &amp; ordinarie Duties, would not beare with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30966:17"/>ſuch a fixed ſtability. It is for glorifyed ſpirits above, to be ever fixed on God, iſſueing flames of Love, towards ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne a beauty. Theſe poore things under the Moone, muſt have a change &amp; variety; our vitall ſpirits, which the immortall mind uſes, for her inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are of a ſtrange kind of mettall; if not uſed at all, they ruſt; if too much, break, or at leaſt grow dull &amp; ſtupid; Truth is, the cheife object of our Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is ſo excellent, ſo glorious, that like the Sunne, look upon it we may, but not gaze thereon. We have known ſad experience of ſome, who venturing too farr &amp; haſtily, have failed &amp; weakned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves, to little fruit. Holy thoughts &amp; affections are the food of the eternall Mind, yet ſince it works not in this our preſent ſtate, without the fancy, her handmaid, she muſt needs flag, when fancy, her ſupport, is tyred out, with too permanent &amp; intenſe ſpeculation, without variety of object. Let it ſuffice thee <hi>Philothea,</hi> to perſever in thy Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſo long as Gods grace shall ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee, without affectation of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30966:17"/>which is not granted us. And when thy ſpirits begin to blunt, leave off, without feare of fickleneſſe; one halfe houre at a time, is a competent meaſure for a weake beginner. As God encreaſeth thy devotion, he will inſpire force, for longer continuance. But by no means paſſe thy preſcribed time, without ſpeciall advice, otherwiſe thou maiſt cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ſpoyle a good enterprize, &amp; A moderate undertaking, with an anguishing concluſion, &amp; hurt thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let me adviſe Thee, not to be too eager in this good work; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve alwayes a calme peace in thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for ſince this work depends more on the help of heaven, then our naturall induſtry, shouldſt thou turmoyle thy Imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with too earneſt diſquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the begining, unreſigned to the time of heavenly aſſiſtance, thou wilt unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily diſable thy felfe, for further aſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Man is not alwayes, in a like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; ſometimes he is longer in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, through ſome unquietneſſe of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or more obſtinate diſtraction; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heavier in the perſeverance, then
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30966:18"/>in the firſt entry, ſometimes more nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; active to diſpatch. How ever thou findeſt thy ſelfe, in the begining or continuance, perſiſt gently, &amp; thou wilt have victory. Other combats are on doubtfull hopes, this on aſſurance; for the ſucceſſe depends on Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which cannot diſapoint thee, if thou faile not in thy purſuance; perſiſt then, &amp; thou wilt prevaile; that which was begun with la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guishing remiſſeneſs &amp; difficulty, shall end in joy &amp; comfort.</p>
                  <p>One dayes meale, however large &amp; liberall, ſtrengthens not for to morrow. The body languisheth, if there be not a ſupply of food; Thou muſt therefore feed thy ſoule, by daily Meditation. The moſt ſerious affections are extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht, by intermiſſion, &amp; by diſuſe doe perish. Lett not therefore any one day paſſe, without a competent time, ſpent therein; break through all letts, except thoſe of obedience &amp; Charity; &amp; when theſe shall have hindred thee, repay thy ſelfe afterwards, the time borrowed, &amp; recompence thy loſſe with a doubled labour; for be aſſured, that too much
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30966:18"/>neglect breeds unaptneſſe to good. Thus much for thy daily Recollection, &amp; for the time choſen or appointed thee; of which, hereafter I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe á fitt Methode.</p>
                  <p>But as for the Ten dayes exerciſe, which I intend ſpecially to recommend unto Thee; I adviſe the uſe of it, only once a yeere; no leſſe, no more. Our Nature is ſo feeble to good, ſo propenſe to evill, that unleſſe we once a yeere, ſett a ſpeciall time a part, wherein to looke into our ſelves, after a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner, &amp; prune ill Cuſtomes &amp; inclinations budding in us, theſe will grow ſo ſtrong, that they will in time choake &amp; kill our little plants of piety. The beſt clock will be out of order, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe taken in peices, &amp; cleanſed once a yeer. There is not any ſo good a Nature but may be corrupted by irregular affections, inſenſibly creeping upon us, which if not timely rectifyed, by a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full induſtry, will gaine the upper hand, &amp; become a ſecond Nature.</p>
                  <p>Yet however neceſſary, a yeerly more ſerious inſpection &amp; ſurvay of our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30966:19"/>lives, &amp; converſations may be, to doe it too oft in one yeere would render a Mind perplext &amp; anxiouſly ſcrupulous; which are diſtempers, incopatible with comfortable Solitude, that requires a generous freedome of the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let thy dayly Meditation ſuffice the reſt of the yeere, for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of errours &amp; miſdemeanours, that creep upon us, in this fraile courſe of mortall life.</p>
                  <p>As for the time of the yeere, when this ſpeciall Exercice is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; 'tis hard to preſcribe one generall Rule for all. Neither can a whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or community, together, lay aſide, at any one preſcribed ſeaſon, all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties, but while <hi>Mary</hi> meditates, <hi>Martha</hi> muſt look to houſehold affaires. Could it be had, there is no time fitter then Lent and Eaſter, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the weather is temperate, the body refreshed anew, by the Suns approach, &amp; Myſteries then repreſented, doe ſtrongly call upon us, for amendment of life; if we doe intend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to partake in the benefitts of Chriſts Paſſion, &amp; Reſurrection. It is a ſigne,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30966:19"/>of a dead &amp; frozen ſoule, not to have an impulſe to Vertue, &amp; a horrour of ſin, when God him ſelfe becomes à Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for us, by shedding his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Bloud upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Altar of the Croſſe, for our Redemption.</p>
                  <p>That is generally ſpeaking, the beſt time, when we deſire to be beſt diſpoſed to piety; for thus have all Chriſtians e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſome particular devotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, on one or other particular ſolemnity, which ſuited beſt with their mind. And ſome are very devout on the day of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, another on that day which had been bleſt with ſome ſpeciall good acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to themſelves or others, as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation to Chriſt by holy Baptiſme, their Initiation in Orders, their Profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Religion, or Delivery by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, from ſome great evill. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of former good ſentiments, are apt, at the recours of the ſeaſon, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them; &amp; reiteration, breeds ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to the like again. Chooſe then Ten dayes before that ſelect time, therein to entertain thy ſelfe in thy happy ſolitude; &amp; ſo behave thy ſelſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30966:20"/>therein, that that day may be a day of peace &amp; Jubily of ſpirit to thee, that thou maiſt iſſue thence, as a ſun forth a Cloud, with a cheerfull alacrity &amp; live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, witneſſing the inward harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thy ſoule. It will then appear, that thy retreat was through a religious zeal of Perfection, not of a penſive ſcruple or dull cuſtome; ſuch a good Day will be a forceing motive to thy ſelfe, to bleſſe thy ſoveraigne Creatour, for that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſt of the joyes of Paradiſe, amidſt the cumberſome cares which are incident to Mortality, &amp; to which every one more or leſſe ſtands ſubject; &amp; edify o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo, to the like felicity.</p>
                  <p>Yet neither are theſe Ten Dayes of ſpeciall ſolitude, ſo to be ſpent, that the ſpirit should unchangably be bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Contemplation, even for that ſpace; Our ſoule muſt be refreshed with ſome variety, it wil otherwiſe grow weary, &amp; our thoughts remiſſe, &amp; affections fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the time thereby ſeeming long to us, &amp; the object tedious; but theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements muſt be short, &amp; tending, at leaſt a far of, to the great deſigne of piety in hand.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:30966:20"/>
                  <p>One time of the day cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to all, no more then one time of the yeere; for neither is Gods grace showred down at particular times, nor doe the various &amp; contrary diſpoſitions of all perſons, agree in the choyce of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. The <hi>Royall Prophet</hi> ſayes, that <hi>In the evening, morning, &amp; midday, he ſpoake to God, to redeem his ſoule, in peace;</hi> in my judgment, ſix, ten &amp; five, would be fitt hours for ſecular perſons; Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who riſe at midnight, muſt obſerve an other Diſtribution, whereof in its due place; ſo <hi>David</hi> ſayes, that <hi>He medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated upon God at the time of Mattins;</hi> all things being then ſtill, the ſoule by the obſcurity of night being recollected from the fancy of other objects, &amp; the body ſome what releaſed from the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe of the paſt dayes cares, the mind will then eaſilyer grow into a likeing &amp; love of heavenly things. Neither is the morning leſſe fit for this heavenly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for then the body newly raiſed, is fully calmed with its late reſt; nor has the ſoule, as yet, had any motiues of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outward Creatures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30966:21"/>the holy <hi>Prophet</hi> ſayd, that <hi>his ſoule thirſted after God, from the morning watch.</hi> Neither is <hi>Iſaacs</hi> time unfitt for this work, <hi>in the Evening he went forth to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the feild,</hi> when the fumes of the middayes refection being diſperſed, the ſoule might eaſily faſten upon divine objects; if thou intendeſt to reape a grounded &amp; permanent benefitt from thy holy retreat, be ſure that, firſt thou make choyce of the fitteſt hours for that purpoſe, then carefully ſett thoſe hours a part, from all other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for change breeds unſetledneſſe, &amp; this an unreaſonable doubt, what time should be apteſt; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy thoughts should be fixed on higher objects.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30966:22"/>I doubt not, <hi>Philothea,</hi> there be many Contemplatiues, but not all good ones; One meditates how to doe his Neighbour a miſcheife, another how to ſin unſeene; &amp; theſe are thoſe, who (as <hi>David</hi> ſayes) <hi>Doe meditate Iniquity in their beds.</hi> Others are buiſy, in the ſearch of the hidden cauſes of viſible effects; &amp; ſo, ſeeking to be acquainted with the whole world, become ſtrangers to their owne home; &amp; whilſt they ſeek to know others, are quite unknowne to them ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Doe you therefore chooſe to medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, on that may doe thee good; The God that made us, the vileneſſe of our body by Nature, the wretchedneſſe of our ſoule by ſin; the aboundance of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the danger of ſudden death, the beauty of Vertue, JESUS CHRIST who bought us, the joyes of Heaven he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us; the myſteries of his life, Death &amp; Reſurrection, the benefitt of the Sacraments, our vocation to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, the payns of Hell, the glorious eſtate of the Bleſſed, &amp; ſuch like, are fitt objects, I should think, to entertayne thy felfe there in.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IT remains now, that I ſay ſomething of the forme &amp; Methode, which thou art to obſerve in dividing thy Meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in handling the parts &amp; points there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But this hath much variety amongſt Contemplatives, &amp; each way is uſefull &amp; laudable, as it is fitted to perſons that uſe it; For ſince there be different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Gods glory, no wonder there should be different means to purchaſe them, according to the variety of each ones diſpoſition; All are not equally, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worldly, or Contemplative; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther equally diſpoſed for the like Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, nor capable of purſueing the ſame heads or points of Meditation. <hi>S. Bonaventures</hi> Methode, uſually practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt us, &amp; liked of by the beſt, is breife, eaſy, well ordred, &amp; much helps the Memory, a faculty which hath great influe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in this bleſſed work.</p>
                  <p>According to this, <hi>Meditation</hi> or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall prayer is divided into three parts, which are, <hi>Preparation, Meditation</hi> (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:30966:23"/>being the cheife part, retains the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall name) &amp; <hi>Concluſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Preparation maketh way for Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Meditation ruminates upon the matter, &amp; giveth ſtrength &amp; life to our Recollection; Concluſion cloſeth up the whole Exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Preparation</hi> firſt places us in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, with whom wee are to make our ſpeciall conference, to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement &amp; comfort, with all feare &amp; reverence.</p>
                  <p>Then ſecondly it chooſeth the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery or ſubject, whereon wee intend as preſent to ſettle our thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly it implores helpe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whereby our weakneſſe may be ſuſtained in this heavenly work, &amp; ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled reſolutely to goe through with it. And truly, ſith the ancient Heathens never attempted any notable buſineſſe, without a ſolemne apprecation of good ſucceſſe, a Chriſtian or Religious ſoule should not preſume to undertake a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall work, of ſuch importance as this is, without firſt craving aide from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, wherein we are unable to doe well,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30966:24"/>without Gods aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beg earneſtly that the progreſſe of our Meditation may be guided &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him, &amp; that he would banish all diſtractions, enlighten our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, quicken our judgment, rectify our will, whett our affections to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, kindle our devotion, &amp; ſo enlarge our hearts towards himſelfe, that wee may find our Imperfections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, vertue ſtrengthned, &amp; our ſoule every way bettered, by our Solitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Meditation</hi> hath alſo three parts; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ponders ſeriouſly the ſubject wee have choſen, thereby to ſtirr up our Affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to God &amp; goodneſſe, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ground our enſueing Reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But care muſt be taken, that the mind be not wracked, by a too vehement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; for this will tire out the phanſy, &amp; interrupt the cheife work. It will ſuffice, to take the moſt pregnant &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. Lett theſe Conſiderations be but three at the moſt; And if thy ſoule finds ſufficient ſatisfaction, light &amp; fruit in the firſt of them, dwell there without going further, &amp; give way to the Holy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30966:24"/>Ghoſt, to work his will in thee. But if thou findeſt not there the expected ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, paſſe quietly on to another; but beſure to goe on ſweetly &amp; eaſily, in thy ſearch, without tiring thy ſelfe too much; thou wilt find little pleaſure in the Kernell, if thou breakeſt thy teeth with the shell.</p>
                  <p>Affection ſucceedeth, where to if our Conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s reach not, they wil prove vain, or to little purpoſe. For this is the ſoule of Meditation, to which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parts ſerve only as inſtruments. As we are reaſonable Creatures by our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; diſcourſe, ſo are we Chriſtians &amp; Religious, by our good will &amp; affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, towards heavenly things. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the former labour of the mind, being undertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to move the Affective part of the ſoule, after the underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding hath traverſt the point propoſed, the will muſt endeavour, by applying her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe therto with all earneſtneſſe, to find ſome feeling relish in it; which fruit, through Gods bleſſing, will follow a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Conſideration of ſome move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing object. And in theſe Affections, we
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30966:25"/>muſt permit our ſoule to ſpread &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, as much as poſſible; if thou findeſt thy heart, to pant &amp; ſwell, with aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſweetneſſe, eaſe it by ſome gentle Aſpirations, &amp; amorous ſighs, as God shall then inſpire Thee.</p>
                  <p>The laſt is Reſolution, wherein, the ſoule bewayling her poverty, dulneſſe &amp; imperfections, which may happily appear then in her, humbles her ſelfe, in regard of her wants &amp; backwardneſſe to Vertue, &amp; deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to particular good purpoſes, for her correction &amp; amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the ſpeciall defects, which she hath diſcovered in her ſelfe. By this means, <hi>Philothea,</hi> thou wilt ſoon correct errours &amp; evill cuſtomes, which by generall Affections &amp; barren deſires, are ſeldome, or very ſlowly refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſion</hi> muſt be performed leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; with profound humility, leaſt by an over-much complacence in our good feelings &amp; motions, which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to work in our ſoules, we looſe the benefit &amp; continuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, &amp; by too ſudden breaking off, we may shew
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30966:25"/>our ſelves careleſſe of the fruit, which wee have ſought with ſo great labour.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, wee muſt give thankes for thoſe Illuminations, Affections &amp; Reſolutions, which God has through his goodneſſe beſtowed upon us, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our Meditation. For ſince a Man naturally cannot be miſerable &amp; in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie, but he muſt complayne &amp; crave ſuccour: ſo neither can a good heart &amp; gratefull ſoule, find it ſelfe in a happy &amp; peacefull conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for it. And this thankfullneſſe gayns an encreaſe of tranquillity.</p>
                  <p>Next follows Oblation, wherein the ſoule recommends her ſelfe, &amp; all her Affections &amp; Reſolutions, to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Gods holy grace; cheerefully giving up her ſelfe to him, ſubmitting to him, &amp; wholly repoſing upon the goodneſſe &amp; mercyes of JESUS CHRIST; deſiring in all things to glorify him, &amp; to walk worthy of his gracious calling.</p>
                  <p>The laſt is Petition, by which wee earneſtly begg, that Almighty God would furnish us, with his grace &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bleſſings, whereby we may be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30966:26"/>enabled, faithfully to put in execution the good purpoſes made by us.</p>
                  <p>And here we muſt take heed, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment not with God, begging help, without an efficacious will to make uſe of it. For God knoweth our hearts, &amp; will not be mocked with faſhionable ſuits, but requireth holy &amp; feeling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, which will appeare in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of what we have reſolved.</p>
                  <p>This forme of Meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyly uſed, will prove (I hope) uery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall; ſo that the ſoule which at the entrance of her Solitude, did but creep upon the Earth, will in the end, ſoare aloft in Heaven, &amp; find herſelfe neer that glorious God, before almoſt out of ſight, transforming her into him ſelfe.</p>

                  <p>One reaſon, why many, even good perſons, make not that progreſſe in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which their calling aymes at, or which themſelves have propoſed, is an over-much confidence in their owne judgment, whereby their Eyes employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in others imperfections, are dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted in their own; by this conceit they make themſelves, as unfitt to be guided by others, as unſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to guide themſelves.

And laſtly he muſt be full of <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> that according to the various tempers of his ſpirituall Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, he may know when, &amp; what reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to apply, whereby to provoke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to a more eager purſuite of Perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to a flight from the many Impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which diſable, in a ſolitary &amp; vertuous life; &amp; which is above all, he muſt not ſo much deſire to gayn upon their good eſteeme, as to make a faithfull uſe of good Counſells, whereby he may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage them in the feare &amp; love of their Soveraign Creatour; If any of theſe three Qualities be wanting, his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct may be unſafe: Wherefore ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beg him of God, &amp; doubt not, but he will rather ſend thee an Angell from Heaven, to direct thee, then lett thee fayle.</p>
                  <p>Having now obtayned ſuch a Guide, bleſſe God for his mercies towards thee, remayne conſtant, &amp; ſeek no other. But goe forward with him, humbly, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,

Let him have a full inſight of thy inclinations &amp; paſſions, &amp; conceale not any notable motion of thy ſoule from him, but lay thy whole heart open before him, as freely &amp; cheerfully, as if thou wert the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to give an account to God, at the great day. So doing, be aſſured, that he who hath promiſed, to reſiſt the proud, &amp; give his graces to the meeke &amp; humble of heart, will by his means more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enlighten thy underſtanding, enflame thy will, &amp; ſecurely lead thee through all difficulties, to reſt &amp; peace.

                           <p>Again, our converſation with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons, oft engages our hearts in ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular affections &amp; ſolicitudes, we being naturally over-prone to adheare to ſenſible ſatisfactions, &amp; too feeble &amp; weake in reſiſting their flattering alure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; therfor are therby putt in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of looſing our beſt hopes; whereas

                           <p>And hence it is, that abandoning ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous converſation with earthlie Creatures, we begin to be converſant with God, &amp; in ſome degree approach to, &amp; imitate the Innocent &amp; peacefull life of the already glorifyed Angells in heaven; Their life &amp; converſation muſt needs be heavenlie, who diſdayning earthlie bleſſings, thirſt after thoſe of the Saints, by knowing, loving &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying him, who alone can make them happy.</p>

Nay what ever other progreſſe we make in our Pilgrimage to Perfection, without a profound humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, we are never ſecure, as appears in Lucifer, &amp; our firſt Parents; Therfor Our Lord JESUS by doctrine &amp; exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, exhorts to the practiſe therof, as the cheife work of Chriſtianitie, the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative of inward peace, &amp; fortifyer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all contradictions.</p>

                           <p>COnſider, That <hi>Patience</hi> being uſefull to all Chriſtians, is ſingularly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the ſolitarie Soul, eſpecially if the Solitude be religious &amp; permanent; It is an eaſie matter out of a bravery of ſpirit, to undergoe ſome notable tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, &amp; abandon worldly ſatisfactions for a while; but to remain conſtant in that Reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this is the ſpeciall work of the Holie Ghoſt, &amp; can never be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accomplisht without a ſingular &amp; profound Patience. It is neceſſary alſo for the practiſe of other Vertues, which are confederates &amp; companions in our pilgrimage to Solitarie perfection; for Patience keeps our ſpirits in peace, what ever befals us; bends it to beare or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, what the hand of providence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points to us; &amp; aſſembles all Vertues, wherby to preſerve in us the hopes of heavenly bleſſings amidſt the toyls of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30966:45"/>this wretched life; Therefore JESUS CHRIST tells us, that by Patience we shall poſſeſſe our Souls.</p>
                           <p>Wherfor <hi>Philothea,</hi> make a breife Reflection on the preſent ſtate of this Vertue in Thee; wherin it is defective, &amp; by what motives it may be advanced to a greater height? Canſt thou with a patient &amp; meek heart, converſe with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, temper others anger with a mild Anſwer, ſuffer injuries in words, &amp; rapin of goods &amp; honour without diſturba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; with bountie &amp; good deeds overcome thy Enemies unjuſt perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; endeavour to reconcile them to thee, even with loſſe of thy own right? Then maiſt thou lay ſome claym to the perfection of Patience, &amp; reap ſome fruit from thy Solitarie Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                           <p>The practiſe alſo of a prompt <hi>Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> is very expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, even in our Retyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a few dayes; but eſpecially, if thy calling be to live permanently in a Communion of Religious perſons, under the conduct of one, whom God hath placed as his Vicegerent over the

In ſuch a Communion, all good things may not be well done, either by all of them, or at all times. Auſteritie (for exemple) is good, yet not to be practiſed againſt the expreſs will of our ſpirituall Guid or Superiour, to the ruin of our own health, &amp; the burthen of others. <hi>Faſt with bread &amp; water</hi> (ſaith a holie Man) <hi>weare a haire shirt, ſleep on the ground, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline the fleſh to the bone, undergoe the moſt contemptible offices, communicate every daie; ſtand from morning till night in Contemplation of God &amp; his attributes; I make no account of all this, if it goes againſt Obedience, &amp; be done in a time, &amp; place, &amp; meaſure unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</hi>

Such a Societie repreſents that bleſſed Communion of the Saints in heaven, as well in God the Center of their Loves; as between themſelvs, by a mutuall congratulation at each others Combatts with ſenſualitie, Victories o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſin &amp; Satan, &amp; ſpeciall favours from their bleſſed Redeemer. And indeed without Charitie, the higheſt ſtate of Perfection is imperfect &amp; ruinous, by reaſon of our naturall frailties, &amp; croſſe

                        <head>SECOND DISCOURSE. <hi>Exerciſes in Solitude.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>IDleneſs is the mother of ſin, our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enimies taking that time, to ſuggeſt evill deſires. Therfore we muſt at all times be well employd, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our Solitude, whither it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, or for ſome ſelected daies. This employment conſiſts not only in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, wherby the Soul is elevated to the boſome of the Divinitie, by the workings of Love; but in a due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance alſo of ſuch Exerciſes, as shall be enjoyned for our profit, eſpecially for the Exaltation of our Unitive life with God. Mentall Contemplations being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while intermitted by corporall labours, return upon the ſpirit, with a greater force &amp; feeling of delight.</p>
                        <p>One great Exerciſe in our Solitude is, <hi>Maſſe</hi> &amp; <hi>Divine Office,</hi> The work of the Angels of God, who ceaſe not night or daie, to ſing forth the praiſes of the Almightie. O heavenlie &amp; divine Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30966:51"/>wherin the glorious Angels accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie us, &amp; offer up for us our prayers to our great God! How much better is it, to be employed in the praiſes of our Creatour, then with the wicked of the world, to be buiſyed in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing, diceing, riotting, &amp; perhaps blaſpheming our Redeemer? Here examine thy readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Church at due times, &amp; whether thou abideſt there as preſent in mind as body? &amp; reſolve henceforth, to aſſiſt with more attention, &amp; greater diligence, in this heavenlie Worke.</p>
                        <p>Another Exerciſe of the ſolitarie Soul, is <hi>Mentall Prayer,</hi> wherby the heart raiſed above earthlie things, confers with God, &amp; is as it were transformed into a Divine <hi>Beeing.</hi> To this, Thou muſt <hi>Philothea</hi> apply thy ſelfe with ſpeciall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, according to the Rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Thee in <hi>Thy Preface.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For it is the Dew of Heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherby the ſpirit is cherished in the knowledg &amp; love of heavenlie things; It is the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Man<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a, to ſuſtayn us during our earthlie aboad in the wilderneſs of this world; It is the holie Mountain of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30966:52"/>Viſions, where we enter into fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conference with God, <hi>Who there shews us all good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A third Dutie is <hi>Reading ſpirituall Bookes,</hi> by which I underſtand holie Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells, &amp; ſuch other devout books as treat of Vertue, &amp; the Reformation of our Manners. This is to be performed duely thrice a daie; at our upriſing, down-laying, &amp; once between both; &amp; that not at ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dom or hap-hazard, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in one, another time in another book, for that is an effect of curioſitie, &amp; rather breeds confuſion then devotion. Let thy daily Lecture therfore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantlie in one good book, reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to Thee by thy own Experience, or ſome Judicious perſon, &amp; therin read till thou haſt not left one line unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; for till then, thou canſt not ſay, thou haſt been a Reader, but rather an Overſeer of the points therin handled.</p>
                        <p>Truely of all bookes I have read, I know none more univerſally profitable for all perſons, of whatſoever condition, then the divine work called <hi>An Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to a Devout Life,</hi> compoſed by that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30966:52"/>Illuminated Man &amp; great ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God <hi>Saint Francis of Sales;</hi> One who even from his Cradle, was ſingularly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Seraphicall Saint Francis, as being born in a Chamber dedicated to his name &amp; devotion. And that thou maiſt ſee, I recommend not this Book to Thee upon ſlight grounds; take the advice of Alexander the ſeventh, the late Pape &amp; Soveraign Head of the Catholique Church on Earth, in a letter dated 1642. to his Nephew; where He ſayes, <hi>That he had already uſed that work for the ſpace of twenty years, &amp; read it over a hundred times, &amp; that he could never read it, without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſome excellent document, not before mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;</hi> which thy own Experience will aſſuredly confirm.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vocall Prayer</hi> &amp; <hi>Aſpirations,</hi> being alſo joyned with ſpirituall reading, much conduce to a greater thirſt &amp; benefit therin; for our reading muſt be ever intermixed with Conſideration, Jacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorie Prayers &amp; Application to uſe; &amp; therefore it matters not, <hi>how much</hi> we read, but <hi>how well,</hi> in order to our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall advancement.</p>

And theſe works are to be perſorm'd with as great pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude &amp; eagerneſſe, as any other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or Solitarie Obſervance, being ſtrong Fortifyers againſt Idleneſs, the bane of the ſpirituall &amp; devout life, which are cheifly aimed at in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from worldly cares.</p>

                           <p>JESUS CHRIST is the true Modell of all Sanctity, therefor we muſt in this our Retyrement, eſpecially ſtudy his Imitation: If he for our ſake, hides the

                           <p>Almighty God hath from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, choſen ſome to be heires of his glory, permitting others; yet doth not any one know, to what ranck he belongs, when, or by what means he shall come thither, till it pleaſeth God to cite us forth this world, &amp; aſſume us to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Paradice; which evidently layeth open our great Ignorance, &amp; proves our unchangable dependance on the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den diſpoſition of the Divine Will; Is not this enough, to humble the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt ſpirit in the world?

                           <p>COnſider, that the ſoul being now cleanſed from all ſtayns of ſin by Repentance, &amp; ſtrengthned in its Spirituall life, by that divine bread, which is JESSUS CHRIST, we muſt uſe all endeavours, to reforme ſuch evill habits &amp; inclinations, as may ſlacken our pious reſolutions; &amp; purchaſe thoſe helps of Vertue, which may moſt efficaciouſlie advance us in our Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to perfection.</p>
                           <p>We muſt therefor <hi>Philothea</hi> withdraw our outward ſenſes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all thoſe objects, which are apt to ſeduce our hearts from Gods Law, &amp; engage them in ſinfull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:30966:74"/>ſo contrary to the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our deſigne. This is done, both by a carefull cuſtody of our ſenſes, from viewing &amp; feeding on ſuch ſenſible objects, as may allure us to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence in them; &amp; by a moderate caſtigation of the body, by acts of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that it rebells not againſt the dictates of reaſon &amp; grace.</p>
                           <p>All Chriſtians have a ſtrickt obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to endeavour this cuſtody &amp; caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſenſes; For being Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the earthly Adam, through whoſe ſin all are borne enemies to God, &amp; Rebells againſt his holy Law, we all find, both body &amp; ſoul alienated from their due Obedience to reaſon &amp; Goſpell, which cannot be repayred, but by withdrawing our ſenſes, even from lawfull objects, &amp; undergoing hard &amp; painfull duties. Being alſo in holy Baptiſme, happily ſpouſed to JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, by a ſolemn Vow then made in our Name, to renounce Satan &amp; all his works, &amp; to apply our ſelves to the obſervance of all CHRISTS Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, we ought ſeriouſly to ſtudy the

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:30966:82"/>in us; wherefor the Holy Apoſtle, <hi>Whence doe warrs &amp; ſtrifes ariſe in us; but from the concupiſcences, which war in our fleshly members?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe therfor muſt neceſſarily, <hi>My Philothea,</hi> be well guarded &amp; ordred in thee if thou deſire that Gods Spirit abide in thee, ſpeak the language of peace to thy heart, &amp; lead thee through the eaſy &amp; even paths of his Love, to the Perfection thou aimeſt at.</p>
                        <p>This Mortification of ſenfes &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, brings alſo with it a ſweet repoſe &amp; quiet of conſcience; For being freed from inward commotions of ſenſuall affections, &amp; not moved by outward allurements, there will be a pleaſant harmony between ſenſe, Reaſon &amp; Grace, under the ſupream govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a bleſſed God; a reſignation to all Varieties of this life, a willingneſſe to accept of what ever condition may befall us; &amp; a promptneſſe to all actions of piety, ſelfe-contempt &amp; mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>By this means <hi>Philothea,</hi> thou wilt enjoy a perfect tranquillity of ſpirit, in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:30966:82"/>order to God, to whoſe will thou wilt promptly ſubmitt, without repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at thoſe adverſities, which through his ſweet providence are permitted to befall thee; In order to Thy ſelfe, being freed from the diſquietts of a troubled Mind; whereas they who give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to the ſatisfying their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortifyed appetites, returning to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by reflexion on their folly, find their hearts overcharged with remorſe &amp; terrours of their own guilt, wherby they become unſupportable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; &amp; laſtly, thou wilt enjoy a moſt entire content in order to thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whoſe paſſions or malice will not be able to shake thy Reſolutions, or diſturbe thy inward tranquillity of ſpirit, now arrived to a high pitch of Inſenſibilitie, to all things of this life.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, by This Mortification is purchaſed an aſſurance of future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe; The ioyes of heaven <hi>Philothea,</hi> have many great Excellencies, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives; they abound with peace &amp; plenty, which muſt be purchaſed by poverty of ſpirit; they afford a perfect
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:30966:83"/>reſt, to be gayned by great Labour; they bring with them a ſolid &amp; perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Comfort, to be obtayned with much ſorrow &amp; patience; &amp; they abide for an endleſſe Eternity, which muſt be procured by an entire Mortification of our ſenſes &amp; paſſions, &amp; a killing of thoſe that would work Iniquity in Gods Holy Citty.</p>
                        <p>This is the way <hi>Philothea,</hi> which all the Saints have walked before us, &amp; it is the adviſe of Our heavenly Lord, that we take up our Croſſe &amp; follow him; For what proportion can there be, between a Member flowing with ſenſuall delights, &amp; a Head crowned with Thornes?

As each one by cordiall friendshipp is transformed into his Friend, &amp; by an exceſs of heavenly Love into our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God: ſo by our joy &amp; alacrity, amidſt the tribulations &amp; croſſes of this
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:30966:122"/>life, we are transformed into, &amp; become <hi>One,</hi> with our Crucified Saviour; whom we then put on, when his Spirit, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, Grace &amp; Mortifications shine in our Soul &amp; actions.</p>
                           <p>The title of a good Chriſtian <hi>Philothea</hi> should, beſides the name, import a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in Life with CHRIST; &amp; that Character of the Croſſe, whereby in the laver of our Spirituall Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we are regiſtred ſouldiers under the conduct of our Crucified Captain, should ever mind us of our profeſſion then made, oft ſince renewed, &amp; now ſo eagerly purſued; that as our Divine Lord &amp; Maſter, with joy marched up towards Hieruſalem the place of his Paſſion, encounters his raging perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutours, &amp; voluntarily offers his body to be beaten on as an anvill, his bloud to be powred forth, &amp; himſelfe to become a ſaving Sacrifice on the Altar of the Croſſe: ſo alſo we should with joy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain, &amp; patiently beare all loſſes, croſſes &amp; deſolations, which may befall us in our Chriſtian Warfar.

                           <p>It is the dignity of a Chriſtian, to be thus United to CHRIST; nor doth any condition of this life render us more unhappy, then want of tribulation; Much Felicity makes us forget we are pilgrims to an endleſs, &amp; endangers our falling into preſumption, while relying on preſent comforts, we arm not our ſelves for enſuing combats, &amp; by long peace leave our hearts unguarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt aſſaults of watchfull Enemies; whereas the bloud of Martyrs has ever been the encreaſe of the Church, &amp; Croſſes the preſervation &amp; ſtrength of Chriſtian Vertues; though Summer be the ſweeteſt ſeaſon, yet without cold winters, earth would become unhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; nor can our Souls long ſavour the ſweetnes of piety, unleſs ſeaſoned with contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; which wee neither

                           <p>Though Expectation diverts not, yet it diminishes the sharpneſs of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which when ſudden, finds the mind unprovided, &amp; unable to beare its weight, for want of Reſolution, &amp; Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Medicines. What if a diſeaſe should bereave thee of health &amp; reſt? What if Poverty as an armed Enimie should rush upon Thee? What if calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies should defame, degrade, or caſt thee into priſon or banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? thou shouldſt <hi>Philothea</hi> now prepare to welcome &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter theſe croſſes with joy, that their violence may not overwhelme Thee, &amp; make thee looſe thy Vertue, in what thou maiſt not avoyd.</p>
                           <p>As Gods wiſe providence in gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us, leads us to, &amp; faſtens us unto the Croſſe: ſo his fatherly Love will ever temper its ſeverity, &amp; render it eaſy &amp; delightfull; Savage beaſts will be ſmitten by their keepers, 'tis God that ſtrikes thee; it were rebellion, to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:30966:124"/>murmur, or fly; he has appointed their weight to the laſt dram, for ends known to himfelfe, none ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> add, or take thence; onely our conſtancy &amp; love can make them light &amp; pleaſant; Although God be in himſelfe immutable, yet for our tryall, he doth not always viſit us after the ſame manner; if He comes as a <hi>Iudge,</hi> &amp; condemns us to ſuffer, 'tis much leſs then our ſins deſerve, that a moments ſorrow may expiate the enormous ſins of an Age, that thou maiſt become like him upon his Croſs, &amp; nigh him in his glory; if as a tender <hi>Father,</hi> tis to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe us now, that we perish not for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; if as an <hi>Eſpous of Bloud,</hi> with a Croſs in one hand, &amp; the other pointing to his wounded heart, 'tis to show, thy heart muſt be peirced too, with the ſword of tribulation; &amp; if as a <hi>Friend,</hi> ſuſpending the influences of his comforting graces, tis to try if thy heart be ſound, not love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his crowns more then his croſſes, or his comforts more then himſelfe.</p>
                           <p>Tribulations too are the cures of our ſick minds; though the body be ſound, the Soul may be diſtempred with pride,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:30966:124"/>incontinency, envy, idleneſs or the like; 'tis a rare ſpirit that has no diſeaſe; no phyſick like an adverſity; If thy heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Phyſitian ſends this, to humble thy heart, to make the continent, meek, or diligent in thy duty, make him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; &amp; be cheerfull in that ſad ſtate, having thy Eie fixt on thy Exemplar, &amp; the great weight of merit &amp; glory which it will work in the patient &amp; reſigned heart.

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:30966:126"/>Vertue is not then firm, when not sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but when not shaken, though moſt aſſayled by adverſity; therefor our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection grows with proportion to our ſuffrings, in the ſociety of our ſuffring Saviour, whoſe Pilgrimage from the cribb to the Croſs, began in tears &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in bloud; ſince therefor <hi>Philothea,</hi> thou art by profeſſion à Chriſtian, &amp; by ſpeciall Reſolution a ſeeker of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Perfection, CHRISTS ſorrows, ſuffrings &amp; croſs, muſt be unto thee a Rule of life, &amp; the Center of all thy motions; the more conformable thou art to him in theſe, the greater will thy perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now be, &amp; happineſs hereafter.</p>
                           <p>Behold then with a ſtedfaſt Eie the Saviour of the World, hanging on the Croſs, &amp; as in his Paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo in his death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned by his Apoſtles, Diſciples &amp; al his uſuall train of applauding attenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. He who in his glory was guarded with millions of Angels, to whom all knees bowe, &amp; who is the Image &amp; Splendour of the glory of his eternal Father, is now forſaken by All. Love made him our Brother, by aſſuming our Nature; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:30966:127"/>are <hi>ſuperfluous,</hi> in order to inward perfection, therefor should be lopt off, that the ſap of grace may quietly fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy in us to life everlaſting, under the conduct of our Divine Guide &amp; Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                           <p>Tell me, <hi>Philothea,</hi> canſt thou like well a <hi>treaſon</hi> in thy boſom friend?
